Cloud SensorII Log File Format
This recommended format gives access to all of the data Cloud Sensor II can provide. The data is similar to the display fields in the Clarity II window. The format has been split across two lines to make it fit on this page:

Date Time T V SkyT AmbT SenT Wind Hum DewPt Hea R W Since Now() Day's c w r d C A
2005-06-03 02:07:23.34 C K -28.5 18.7 22.5 45.3 75 10.3 3 0 0 00004 038506.08846 1 2 1 0 0 0 

The header line is here just for illustration. It does not actually appear anywhere.

The fields mean:
Date 1-10 local date yyyy-mm-dd
Time 12-22 local time hh:mm:ss.ss (24 hour clock)
T 24 temperature units displayed and in this data, 'C' for Celsius or 'F' for Fahrenheit
V 26 wind velocity units displayed and in this data, ‘K’ for km/hr or ‘M’ for mph or 'm' for m/s
SkyT 28-33 sky-ambient temperature, 999. for saturated hot, -999. for saturated cold, or –998. for wet
AmbT 35-40 ambient temperature
SenT 41-47 sensor case temperature, 999. for saturated hot, -999. for saturated cold. Neither saturated condition should ever occur.
Wind 49-54 wind speed or:
	-1. if still heating up,
	-2. if wet,
	-3. if the A/D from the wind probe is bad (firmware <V56 only) ,
	-4. if the probe is not heating (a failure condition),
	-5. if the A/D from the wind probe is low (shorted, a failure condition) (firmware >=V56 only),
	-6. if the A/D from the wind probe is high (no probe plugged in or a failure) (firmware >=V56 only).
Hum 56-58 relative humidity in %
DewPt 60-65 dew point temperature
Hea 67-69 heater setting in %
R 71 rain flag, =0 for dry, =1 for rain in the last minute, =2 for rain right now
W 73 wet flag, =0 for dry, =1 for wet in the last minute, =2 for wet right now
Since 75-79 seconds since the last valid data
Now() Day's 81-92 date/time given as the VB6 Now() function result (in days) when Clarity II last wrote this file
c 94 cloud condition (see the Cloudcond enum in section 20)
w 96 wind condition (see the Windcond enum in section 20)
r 98 rain condition (see the Raincond enum in section 20)
d 100 daylight condition (see the Daycond enum in section 20)
C 102 roof close, =0 not requested, =1 if roof close was requested on this cycle
A 104 alert, =0 when not alerting, =1 when alerting
